# CrumbsGL
A very small library to make managing OpenGL and SDL3 easier.
The library uses OpenGL Direct State Access, so support for at least version 4.5
is needed.

The library aims to have functions for creating and managing Textures and Buffers, as well as managing SDL3 events
and a small GUI system.
